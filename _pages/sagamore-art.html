          <p>In partnership with renowned gallery 55Bellechasse, we are thrilled to be presenting an ambitious and extensive solo show by <strong>Jason Newsted</strong>. The exceptional exhibit is a survey of 12 years of work, along with new, site-specific installations that reflect Newsted’s lifelong commitment to painting inspired by his extensive career as a Grammy-Award winning musician. As the former bassist and vocalist of Metallica, his visual display illustrates the dynamic parallel between music, history and human expressions.</p>
          <p>The artist will also be performing live with his ensemble, The Chophouse Band, at our Private Opening on Wednesday, December 5th and the Sagamore Brunch on Saturday, December 8th.</p>
