The exceptional exhibit is a survey of 12 years of work, along with new, site-specific installations that reflect Newsted&rsquo;s lifelong commitment to painting inspired by his extensive career as a Grammy-Award winning musician. As the former bassist and vocalist of Metallica, his visual display illustrates the dynamic parallel between music, history and human expressions.</p>\n<p>The artist&nbsp;performed live with his ensemble, The Chophouse Band, at our Private Opening on Wednesday, December 5th and at the Sagamore Brunch on Saturday, December 8th.</p>",
